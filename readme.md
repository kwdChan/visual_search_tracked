# Visual search with Eye Tracking
A program to run the visual search task using PychoPy, with eye tracking using EyeLink 1000. 

A fixation cross appears at the beginning of each trial, and the subject has to maintain fixation on it for one second before the task begins. The program enters the calibration mode if the subject fails to maintain fixation after 10 seconds. The cross turns red when the program determines the subject is fixating on it. 

A drift correction dot appears every 5 trials at one of the four corners to adjust for small head movements.
